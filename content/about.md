title: About Me
---

I'm currenly a student at the *National Taiwan University*, majoring in *Computer Science and Information Engineering*. I have a keen interest in software development, particularly in web technologies and machine learning.

My curiosity drives me to experiment with innovative tools and frameworks, always seeking better ways to build and create.  When I'm not coding, you might find me reading about the latest tech trends, contributing to open-source projects, or tweaking my setup to make it just right. Let's connect to talk code, tech, or the next big thing!

# Tech Focus
As I really enjoy tinkering with new technologies, and rice my setup, I have been exploring various tools and frameworks. Here are some of the technologies I am currently focused on but not limited to:
- **Nix and NixOS**
- **Neovim**
- **Hyprland**
- **Rust**
- **Go**

These tools not only enhance my productivity but also allow me to create a more efficient and enjoyable development environment.

# About This Site
The site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and flexible static site generator using Go. The theme is based on [hugo-coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder). In this site, I share my thoughts, projects, and experiments with various technologies. The goal is to create a space where I can document my learning journey and share insights with others. It can be written in either Chinese or English, depending on the topic and audience.
